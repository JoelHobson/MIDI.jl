  abstract  = {Groove is often described as the experience of music that makes people tap their feet and want to dance. A high degree of consistency in ratings of groove across listeners indicates that physical properties of the sound signal contribute to groove [Madison (2006) Music Perception, 24, 201-208]. Here, correlations were assessed between listeners’ ratings and a number of quantitative descriptors of rhythmic properties for one hundred music examples from five distinct traditional music genres. Groove was related to several different rhythmic properties, some of which were genre-specific and some of which were general across genres. Two descriptors corresponding to the density of events between beats and the salience of the beat, respectively, were strongly correlated with groove across domains. In contrast, systematic deviations from strict positions on the metrical grid, socalled microtiming, did not play any significant role. The results are discussed from a functional perspective of rhythmic music to enable and facilitate entrainment and precise synchronisation among individuals.

  abstract  = {A POPULAR THEORY HOLDS THAT "SWING" STEMS specifically from asynchronous timing between bass and drums in their shared articulation of the beat, a phenomenon Charles Keil has dubbed "participatory discrepancies" (PDs; Keil, 1987). The "push and pull" between these instruments purportedly generates a "productive tension" thought to drive the groove with energy. This paper presents the results of two experiments on the perception of PDs. Experiment 1 employed synthetic recordings of a conventional swing groove in which the onset asynchronies between bass and drums were varied. Participants used three listening strategies to perceive the asynchrony and its purported effects. Experiment 2 employed recordings of professional jazz musicians and tested for the effects of learning in the perception of PDs. Little evidence emerged from either experiment in support of the PD framework. An alternative proposal drawn from metric entrainment theory explains the effects of PDs as more limited and local than previously thought.},

Our experiment analyzed the influence of early or late time shift of both bass drum and snare drum on the perceived musical quality of a short, simple drum pattern in rock style. In a web-based study, music students (N = 93) listened to a simple drum pattern played on a snare and a bass drum and evaluated the musical quality (in terms of the “groove quality”) of five degrees of microtiming deviations (early and late time shifts of the two instruments by −25 ms, −15 ms, 0 ms, +15 ms, and +25 ms). We found 5 significant results: (a) The highest ratings of perceived drum pattern quality were given for the rhythmically accurate (quantized) version; (b) the increasing deviation in microtiming resulted in lower quality ratings; (c) the evaluation of drum pattern quality showed a characteristic asymmetry of ratings for the two directions of deviations: early time shift was rated more negatively than the comparable late time shift; (d) in general, microtiming deviations on the snare drum were rated worse than comparable deviations on the bass drum; (e) the subjects’ degree of expertise in rock and pop music had no influence on the ratings. We conclude that at least some styles of modern groove-oriented music are characterized by an aesthetics of “exactitude” and a groove effect independent of microtiming deviations. Consequences for the aesthetic appreciation of different styles of music are discussed.},

To better understand the mechanisms that lead to the sensation of groove, we explore the relationship between groove and systematic microtiming deviations. Manifested as small, intentional deviations in timing, systematic microtiming is widely considered within the music community to be a critical component of music performances that groove. To investigate the effect of microtiming on the perception of groove we synthesized typical rhythm patterns for Jazz, Funk, and Samba with idiomatic microtiming deviation patterns for each style. The magnitude of the deviations was parametrically varied from nil to about double the natural level. In two experiments, untrained listeners and experts listened to all combinations of same and different music and microtiming style and magnitude combinations, and rated liking, groove, naturalness, and speed. Contrary to a common and frequently expressed belief in the literature, systematic microtiming led to decreased groove ratings, as well as liking and naturalness, with the exception of the simple short-long shuffle Jazz pattern. A comparison of the ratings between the two listener groups revealed this effect to be stronger for the expert listener group than for the untrained listeners, suggesting that musical expertise plays an important role in the perception and appreciation of microtiming in rhythmic patterns.},

Two professional rhythm section performances (bass/drums) in swing and funk style were recorded, and the performances' original microtemporal deviations from a regular metronomic grid were scaled to several levels of magnitude. Music expert (n = 79) and non-expert (n = 81) listeners rated the groove qualities of stimuli using a newly developed questionnaire that measures three dimensions of the groove experience (Entrainment, Enjoyment, and the absence of Irritation). Findings show that music expert listeners were more sensitive to microtiming manipulations than non-experts. Across both expertise groups and for both styles, groove ratings were high for microtiming magnitudes equal or smaller than those originally performed and decreased for exaggerated microtiming magnitudes. In particular, both the fully quantized music and the music with the originally performed microtiming pattern were rated equally high on groove. This means that neither the claims of PD theory (that microtiming deviations are necessary for groove) nor the opposing exactitude hypothesis (that microtiming deviations are detrimental to groove) were supported by the data.

In the past, there was some consensus among both musicians and researchers that the main factor in inducing this feeling is onset asynchrony of sounds. However, recent studies have asserted that no-asynchrony is the condition that will obtain the highest groove. The current study examined whether no-asynchrony exclusively elicits the highest groove. In Experiment 1, we measured the groove increment of a backbeat drum pattern as a function of the asynchronies between bass guitar and hi-hat cymbal sounds. Upon evaluation, the scores of no conditions exceeded those of the synchronous condition. However, the condition with slight bass guitar precedence over the hi-hat achieved an approximately equal score to the condition with complete synchrony, and that score was higher than the ones achieved with bass delay. In Experiment 2, we measured the participants{\textquoteright} sensitivities to timing discrimination. The results confirmed that the amount of bass precedence in Experiment 1 was perceptible to the listeners. These findings suggest that complete synchronization is not always the best condition to achieve groove and that listeners prefer perceivable asynchronies in some cases.},

ing, synchronisation and dynamics in jazz trio performances.
In a production experiment, six trio combinations of one sax-
ophonist, two bassists, and three drummers were recorded
while they performed three popular jazz songs. Onset timing
and dynamics of each performer were extracted and analysed.
Results showed that the tempo was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
the timing of the drummers and all performers showed higher
temporal precision on the backbeats. The drummers demon-
strated individual swing-ratios, accentuations of beats and
intrapersonal asynchronies between simultaneous hi-hat and
ride cymbal onsets, which resulted in a hi-hat played 2–26 ms
ahead of the pulse of the music. In a subsequent perception test,
participants (N = 26) rated 12 excerpts of the jazz recordings.
They selected their preferred version from a pool of stimuli
containing the original version, but also manipulations with
artiﬁcially increased or reduced asynchronies. Stimuli with
reduced asynchronies smaller than 19 ms were preferred by
the listeners over the original or the fully quantised timing.
This suggests that listeners endorse a ‘tight-interlocked’ jazz
rhythm section, with asynchronies smaller than the percep-
tual threshold (temporal masking), but with natural timing
variabilities that makes it distinguishable from a computer-
generated playback.

asynchronies (microtiming) in music performance are crucial for prompting bodily
entrainment in listeners, which is a fundamental effect of the “groove” experience.
Previous research has failed to find evidence to support this theory. The present study
tested the influence of varying PD magnitudes on the beat-related body movement
behavior of music listeners. 160 participants (79 music experts, 81 non-experts) listened
to 12 music clips in either Funk or Swing style. These stimuli were based on two audio
recordings (one in each style) of expert drum and bass duo performances. In one series of
six clips, the PDs were downscaled from their originally performed magnitude to complete
quantization in steps of 20%. In another series of six clips, the PDs were upscaled
from their original magnitude to double magnitude in steps of 20%. The intensity of the
listeners’ beat-related head movement was measured using video-based motion capture
technology and Fourier analysis. A mixed-design Four-Factor ANOVA showed that the
PD manipulations had a significant effect on the expert listeners’ entrainment behavior.
The experts moved more when listening to stimuli with PDs that were downscaled by
60% compared to completely quantized stimuli. This finding offers partial support for PD
theory: PDs of a certain magnitude do augment entrainment in listeners. But the effect
was found to be small to moderately sized, and it affected music expert listeners only.

invention and not from the directives of music notation, a composer
wishing to emulate jazz rubatos faces an interesting technical challenge.

be simulated using standard music notation. My goal is to bridge aspects

Varying the Beat-Upbeat Ratio (BUR)—i.e., moving between straight and swing eighth notes—enables jazz musicians to manipulate the flow of motional energy across a phrase in systematic ways in conjunction with other melodic processes. Analyses of melodic phrases by John Coltrane, Lee Konitz, and Sonny Clark reveal the centrality of such aspects of microrhythmic expression to the affective power of jazz improvisation.

We first anticipate listeners’ perceptual response using the theories of entrainment and dynamic attending as points of departure. We then report on a motion capture experiment aimed at engaging listeners’ motion patterns in response to the two parts of the tune. The results show that when multiple onsets are introduced in part 2, the half note becomes a significant additional level of entrainment and the temporal locations of the perceived beats are drawn towards the added onsets.},

Data available from two studies (Alén, 1995; McGuiness, 2005) yield phase deviations in the range of approximately 5msecs to 50msecs in absolute values. The existence of phase corrections in response to subliminal timing perturbations - below the detection threshold for ISI changes - has been established in a number of studies (Repp, 2000, 2001a, 2001b, 2002a, 2002b; M. Thaut, Tian, \& Azimi-Sadjadi, 1998; M. H. Thaut \& Kenyon, 2003). Entrainment models incorporating separate phase correction and period correction terms have been described by (E.W.

Wing \& Kristofferson, 1973a). This paper proposes that 1) systematic microtiming deviations are phase shifts; and that 2) phase correction processes in entrainment are located in the motor (implementation) stage of the Wing \& Kristofferson model. The idea of functional anticipation is introduced, which accounts for entrainment phase corrections, microtiming deviations, synchronisation error in tapping studies, and adaptation to latency in musical instruments.},

  abstract  = {The timing in jazz ensemble performances was investigated in order to approach the question of what makes the music “swing.” One well-known aspect of swing is that consecutive eighth notes are performed as longshort patterns. The exact duration ratio (the swing ratio) of the longshort pattern has been largely unknown. In this study, the swing ratio produced by drummers on the ride cymbal was measured. Three wellknown jazz recordings and a play-along record were used. A substantial and gradual variation of the drummers’ swing ratio with respect to tempo was observed. At slow tempi, the swing ratio was as high as 3.5:1, whereas at fast tempi it reached 1:1. The often-mentioned “triple-feel,” that is, a ratio of 2:1, was present only at a certain tempo. The absolute duration of the short note in the long-short pattern was constant at about 100 ms for medium to fast tempi, suggesting a practical limit on tone duration that may be due to perceptual factors. Another aspect of swing is the soloist’s timing in relation to the accompaniment. For example, a soloist can be characterized as playing “behind the beat.” In the second part, the swing ratio of the soloist and its relation to the cymbal accompaniment was measured from the same recordings. In slow tempi, the soloists were mostly playing their downbeats after the cymbal but were synchronized with the cymbal at the off-beats. This implied that the swing ratio of the soloist was considerably smaller than the cymbal accompaniment in slow tempi. It may give an impression of “playing behind” but at the same time keep the synchrony with the accompaniment at the off-beat positions. Finally, the possibilities of using computer tools in jazz pedagogy are discussed.},

A total of 949 eighth note samples from five improvised solos by saxophonist Chris Potter were analysed. Musical variables included metrical beat placement, melodic character, intervals, articulation, underlying harmony, and tempo. Results of the simultaneous multiple regression analyses revealed that intervals preceding and intervals succeeding the sample eighth notes had a significant effect on eighth note durations. Articulation had a significant effect on upbeat beat ratio. The relationships between the relative onset timing data of the saxophone, bass, and drums yielded significant results. There was a large, negative correlation between the relative timing onsets of saxophone and bass, a large negative correlation between saxophone and drums, and a moderate, negative correlation between bass and drums. Implications for the fields of music education, pedagogy, and cognitive psychology are discussed.},

new rhythm that departs from the underlying metric grid. In this paper I examine two types of
transformation within the context of 1920s jazz. The Flux (F) transformation distorts the original
rhythmic template by molding it into an acceleration, a deceleration, or a combination of these.
The Shift (S) transformation changes the global tempo of the template. At the heart of these oper-
ations lies the concept of an anchor, an on-the-beat synchronization point between soloist and accom-
paniment that metrically grounds the transformation. Soloists use F and S—often in conjunction—
to shape their rhythms and to control the level of tension/resolution in relation to the underlying
beat.

In doing so they synchronise their voices and bodily movements to a shared, repeating interval of time, the musical pulse, beat or tactus. We take this capacity to “entrain” to an evenly paced stimulus (isochrony) so much for granted that it may come as a surprise to learn that from a biological point of view such behaviour is exceptional. But it is not altogether unique. There are a number of other species, none of them closely related to humans, that also engage in group synchrony of behaviour through entrainment to an isochronous pulse. Despite their evolutionary distance from us their life circumstances throw an interesting light on the possible origin and nature of our own entrainment capacity. Here we consider this capacity in terms of its possible origin, functional mechanisms, and ontogenetic development.},

  abstract  = {The score is a symbolic encoding that describes a piece of music, written according to the conventions of music theory, which must be rendered as sound (e.g., by a performer) before it may be perceived as music by the listener. In this paper we provide a step towards unifying music theory with music perception in terms of the relationship between notated rhythm (i.e., the score) and perceived syncopation. In our experiments we evaluated this relationship by manipulating the score, rendering it as sound and eliciting subjective judgments of syncopation. We used a metronome to provide explicit cues to the prevailing rhythmic structure (as defined in the time signature). Three-bar scores with time signatures of 4/4 and 6/8 were constructed using repeated one-bar rhythm-patterns, with each pattern built from basic half-bar rhythm-components. Our manipulations gave rise to various rhythmic structures, including polyrhythms and rhythms with missing strong- and/or down-beats. Listeners (N = 10) were asked to rate the degree of syncopation they perceived in response to a rendering of each score. We observed higher degrees of syncopation in time signatures of 6/8, for polyrhythms, and for rhythms featuring a missing down-beat. We also found that the location of a rhythm-component within the bar has a significant effect on perceived syncopation. Our findings provide new insight into models of syncopation and point the way towards areas in which the models may be improved.},

Across two experiments we examine listeners’ experience of groove to synthesized musical stimuli covering a range of syncopation levels and densities of musical events, according to formal rules implemented by a computer algorithm that shifts musical events from strong to weak metrical positions. Results indicate that moderate levels of syncopation lead to significantly higher groove ratings than melodies without any syncopation or with maximum possible syncopation. A comparison between the various trans-formations and the way they were rated shows that there is no simple relation between syncopation magnitude and groove.},

  abstract  = {Moving to music is an essential human pleasure particularly related to musical groove. Structurally, music associated with groove is often characterised by rhythmic complexity in the form of syncopation, frequently observed in musical styles such as funk, hip-hop and electronic dance music. Structural complexity has been related to positive affect in music more broadly, but the function of syncopation in eliciting pleasure and body-movement in groove is unknown. Here we report results from a web-based survey which investigated the relationship between syncopation and ratings of wanting to move and experienced pleasure. Participants heard funk drum-breaks with varying degrees of syncopation and audio entropy, and rated the extent to which the drum-breaks made them want to move and how much pleasure they experienced. While entropy was found to be a poor predictor of wanting to move and pleasure, the results showed that medium degrees of syncopation elicited the most desire to move and the most pleasure, particularly for participants who enjoy dancing to music. Hence, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between syncopation, body-movement and pleasure, and syncopation seems to be an important structural factor in embodied and affective responses to groove.},

Musical rhythms are not entirely accurate and thus inevitably deviate from the ideal beat pattern. Nevertheless, computer generated perfect beat patterns are frequently devalued by listeners due to a perceived lack of human touch. Professional audio editing software therefore offers a humanizing feature which artificially generates rhythmic fluctuations. However, the built-in humanizing units are essentially random number generators producing only simple uncorrelated fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we establish long-range fluctuations as an inevitable natural companion of both simple and complex human rhythmic performances. Moreover, we demonstrate that listeners strongly prefer long-range correlated fluctuations in musical rhythms. Thus, the favorable fluctuation type for humanizing interbeat intervals coincides with the one generically inherent in human musical performances.},

by a characteristic time scale. In addition, we detect subtle features in Porcaro’s drumming
such as small drifts in the 16\textsuperscript{th} note pulse and non-trivial periodic two-bar patterns in both
hi-hat amplitudes and intervals. Through this investigation we introduce a step towards statistical

While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One process dominates on short timescales ({\$}t {\textless} 8{\$} beats) and reflects microtiming variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop. Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.},

Der Gold-MSI orientiert sich am mehrdimensionalen Konstrukt der Musikalischen Erfahrenheit, das davon ausgeht, dass musikalische Fähigkeiten und Umgangsweisen nicht allein durch Unterricht an einem Musikinstrument, sondern auch durch die aktive Auseinandersetzung mit Musik in all ihren Facetten erworben werden können. Der an einer großen englischsprachigen Stichprobe entwickelte Fragebogen (Müllensiefen et al., 2014) erfasst musikalische Expertise mittels fünf Faktoren sowie einem globalen Faktor der Allgemeinen Musikalischen Erfahrenheit. Der englische Gold-MSI-Fragebogen wurde ins Deutsche übersetzt, und anhand einer deutschsprachigen Stichprobe (N = 641) konnte die Faktorenstruktur mittels einer konfirmatorischen Faktorenanalyse bestätigt werden. Des Weiteren weisen alle fünf Einzelfaktoren sowie der globale Faktor Allgemeine Musikalische Erfahrenheit gute bis sehr gute Reliabilitäten auf (Werte von Cronbach‘s alpha zwischen 0,72 und 0,91). Zusätzlich werden Zusammenhänge zwischen Variablen des sozioökonomischen Status und den Faktoren des Gold-MSI in der deutschen Stichprobe anhand eines Strukturgleichungsmodells dargelegt. Das statistische Modell zeigt positive Zusammenhänge zwischen Einkommen und beruflichem Status auf der einen und musikalischer Ausbildung, Wahrnehmungsfähigkeiten und emotionalem Umgang mit Musik auf der anderen Seite auf  . Das Fragebogeninventar ist frei verfügbar und soll zur differenzierten Untersuchung Musikalischer Erfahrenheit und Expertise im deutschsprachigen Raum beitragen.

@article{Rasanen2015,
abstract = {Long-range correlated temporal fluctuations in the beats of musical rhythms are an inevitable consequence of human action. According to recent studies, such fluctuations also lead to a favored listening experience. The scaling laws of amplitude variations in rhythms, however, are widely unknown. Here we use highly sensitive onset detection and time series analysis to study the amplitude and temporal fluctuations of Jeff Porcaro's one-handed hi-hat pattern in "I Keep Forgettin'"-one of the most renowned 16th note patterns in modern drumming. We show that fluctuations of hi-hat amplitudes and interbeat intervals (times between hits) have clear long-range correlations and short-range anticorrelations separated by a characteristic time scale. In addition, we detect subtle features in Porcaro's drumming such as small drifts in the 16th note pulse and non-trivial periodic two-bar patterns in both hi-hat amplitudes and intervals. Through this investigation we introduce a step towards statistical studies of the 20th and 21st century music recordings in the framework of complex systems. Our analysis has direct applications to the development of drum machines and to drumming pedagogy.},

@article{Hennig2014,
abstract = {Though the music produced by an ensemble is influenced by multiple factors, including musical genre, musician skill, and individual interpretation, rhythmic synchronization is at the foundation of musical interaction. Here, we study the statistical nature of the mutual interaction between two humans synchronizing rhythms. We find that the interbeat intervals of both laypeople and professional musicians exhibit scale-free (power law) cross-correlations. Surprisingly, the next beat to be played by one person is dependent on the entire history of the other person's interbeat intervals on timescales up to several minutes. To understand this finding, we propose a general stochastic model for mutually interacting complex systems, which suggests a physiologically motivated explanation for the occurrence of scale-free cross-correlations. We show that the observed long-term memory phenomenon in rhythmic synchronization can be imitated by fractal coupling of separately recorded or synthesized audio tracks and thus applied in electronic music. Though this study provides an understanding of fundamental characteristics of timing and synchronization at the interbrain level, the mutually interacting complex systems model may also be applied to study the dynamics of other complex systems where scale-free cross-correlations have been observed, including econophysics, physiological time series, and collective behavior of animal flocks.},
